\begintext
At the moment, coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations are widely used to simulate the dynamics of BEC. This method is easy and relatively fast, and it allows one to obtain rather accurate predictions for the evolution of cloud structure$^1$. The problem is that it starts to produce incorrect results for low number of particles or long evolution times, and requires the addition of various phenomenological terms and coefficients. But there are theoretically strict ways to improve GPE-based simulations, one of which is the inclusion of quantum noise terms. 

The noise can be taken into account by writing the master equation for the condensate and transforming it into one of the quasiprobability representations, like \mbox{positive-P}$^{2, 3}$ or Wigner$^2$. The resulting equation can then be expressed as a set of stochastic equations, which can be solved numerically. I present the results of such simulations for several types of experiments on $^{87}$Rb condensates (namely, the two-component clouds of $\vert1,-1\rangle$ and $\vert2,-1\rangle$ states in magnetic trap), performed in Swinburne CAOUS lab. In addition, I use the simulation data to revise the values of scattering lengths and loss terms for these components.
