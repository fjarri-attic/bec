Submission of abstracts for the International Conference on Atomic
Physics (ICAP) 2010 is very simple: use this example file as a
template for your abstract. Please follow the guidelines:

\begin{itemize}

\item Stay within the one page limit.

\item Include your title and to list all authors, each one in a
  separate \verb+\author+ command, with the following syntax:\\
  \verb+\author{initials}{name}{address identifier}+,\\
  where \verb+address identifier+ corresponds to one of the address
  identifiers (see below).

\item Provide the address(es) of all author(s) using the
  \verb+\address+ command with the following syntax:\\
  \verb+\address{address identifier}{address text}+

\item Include references with the \verb+\footnote+
  command\footnote{T.~Oetiker, H.~Partl, I.~Hyna and E.~Schlegl,
    ``A (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX2e.'',
    freely available for download from many locations.
    }.

  If you want to refer twice to the same reference use the command
  ``\verb+$^x$+'', where \verb+x+ stands for the reference number.

\item Include figures (see Fig.~1) with the \verb+\includegraphics+
  command as in the example below. (Do not use the \verb+figure+
  environment!)  See the {\LaTeX} documentation\footnote{Keith Reckdahl,
    ``Using Imported Graphics in Latex and pdfLatex'',
    freely available for download from many locations.}  for more details on possible
  options. The caption command for icap2010 abstracts is
  as following: \verb+\caption{id}{caption text}+
\end{itemize}

\caption{1}{Cairns Esplanade lagoon. You can position
  the figure within the text using standard {\LaTeX}
  commands$^{1,2}$.}
